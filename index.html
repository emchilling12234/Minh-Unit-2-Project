    <p class="about"> This site is focused on spreading awareness on Asian Hate and how it has affected Asian
      Americans as a whole as this problem hasn't been addressed a lot of news and media. Even though the surge of hate
      speech and hate crime against Asian American was larger during amd after the COVID-19 pandemic, this isn't
      addressed enough due to news outlets shining a bad light on China and COVID, which leads to a lot of people
      blaming Asian Americans for the whole thing. Down here is a statistics of hate crime during Pandemic years.</p>
